## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. BERT Reasoning Engine (`src/core/bert_engine.py`)
- Advanced language processing with BERT integration
- Chain-of-thought reasoning implementation
- Confidence scoring and attention analysis
- Real-time performance metrics

#### 2. AI Agent Core (`src/core/ai_agent.py`)
- PhD-level cognitive architecture
- Dynamic knowledge acquisition
- Working memory management
- State management and callbacks

#### 3. Learning System (`src/training/learning_system.py`)
- Adaptive learning algorithms
- Knowledge graph construction
- Concept relationship mapping
- Progress validation

#### 4. Quality Metrics (`src/monitoring/quality_metrics.py`)
- Real-time accuracy tracking
- Source quality assessment
- Expected discovery patterns
- Comprehensive monitoring dashboard

#### 5. Interactive Demo (`src/demonstration/interactive_demo.py`)
- Scenario-based demonstrations
- Performance evaluation
- Interactive response generation
- Success metrics calculation

#### 6. GUI Framework (`src/gui/main_window.py`)
- Modern interface design
- Real-time visualization
- Control panel integration
- Progress monitoring

#### 7. Text PSO Synthesis (rule-based, new) (`src/synthesis/`)
- Minimal PSO loop that evolves agent-system specs (roles + workflow) without external LLMs
- Files:
  - `src/synthesis/agent_spec.py`: schema for roles and workflow
  - `src/synthesis/eval.py`: heuristic fitness (coverage, verification, balance)
  - `src/synthesis/pso_text.py`: `PSOSwarmSynthesizer` running a small population over iterations
- Demo integration: a new scenario ‚ÄúAgent Synthesis via PSO (Rule-based)‚Äù runs this loop and shows the best system
- Note: This bridges to the paper‚Äôs idea. Full language-driven PSO with prompt-based mutations is out of scope here.

## Configuration

### Application Settings
The system can be configured by modifying the configuration in `main.py`:

```python
config = {
    "bert_model_path": "bert-base-uncased-mrpc/...",
    "academic_paper_path": "academic_summary.md",
    "max_sequence_length": 512,
    "quality_metrics_window": 1000,
    "enable_real_time_monitoring": True,
    "demo_auto_start": False,
    "export_results": True
}
```

### BERT Model Configuration
- Default: Intel optimized BERT base uncased MRPC
- Location: `bert-base-uncased-mrpc/bert-base-uncased-mrpc/huggingface_Intel_bert-base-uncased-mrpc_v1`
- Supports custom BERT models with compatible interfaces

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Installation Problems
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all requirements are installed
- **Python Version**: Verify Python 3.8+ is being used
- **Virtual Environment**: Use virtual environment to avoid conflicts

#### Runtime Issues
- **BERT Model Loading**: Verify model path and files exist
- **Memory Issues**: Ensure sufficient RAM (8GB minimum)
- **GUI Problems**: Check display resolution and graphics drivers

#### Performance Issues
- **Slow Training**: Consider GPU acceleration or reduce sequence length
- **High Memory Usage**: Adjust batch sizes and window sizes
- **Unresponsive GUI**: Check for blocking operations in main thread

### Error Messages
- **"BERT model not found"**: Check model path configuration
- **"Academic paper not found"**: Verify `academic_summary.md` exists
- **"GUI initialization failed"**: Check tkinter installation
- **"Import errors"**: Verify all dependencies are installed

### Text PSO Synthesis Configuration (optional)
- Env `USE_LLM_PSO=1`: Enables LLM-driven mutations in the text-based PSO agent synthesis.
- Env `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required if `USE_LLM_PSO=1`. Optionally set `OPENAI_MODEL` (default `gpt-4o-mini`) and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for compatible endpoints.
- When enabled, the "Agent Synthesis" step runs a small PSO over agent specs and the visualization switches to a real population view (mode `text_pso`).
